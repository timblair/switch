# Switch

[Switch][] is a card game for 2 or more players, similar to [Uno][], but played
with a regular deck of playing cards.  Players take it in turns to play a
single card that matches the previously played card in either suit or rank; if
the player has not suitable card in their hand, they must pick up a new card
from the stock.  The aim is to get rid of your cards before any other player.

## Rules

* For between 2 to 5 players, a single deck of cards is used.  For more than 5
  players, two decks are used.
* Each player is dealt 7 cards, and the top card of the remaining stock is
  placed face-up on the table.
* Players take it in turns to play a single card that matches the current
  face-up card in either suit or rank.  If the player cannot play, they must
  pick up one card from the stcok to add to their hand, and play moves on to
  the next player.
* The winner is the first player to play all their cards.

### Power Cards

In general, play continues based on the rules set out above.  Some cards have
a special meaning:

* **2**: if a two of any suit is played, the next player must pick up two
  cards.  If the next player can play a two, then the following player must
  pick up four cards, unless they themselves can play a two, in which case the
  following player must pick up six, and so on.  The player picking up cards
  cannot forfeits their regular turn.
* **8**: the next player misses their turn.
* **King**: play reverses direction.
* **Ace**: is a wild card, and can be played regardless of the suit and colour
  of the face-up card.  The player who plays the ace gets to choose which suit
  has to be played by the next person.
